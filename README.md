# C4D Point Autorig
Automatically rig Cinema 4D splines with nulls for easier animation.
Updated to Python 3 for C4D R23.

## Installation
Copy the Python file to your Cinema 4D library/scripts folder, restart or open Cinema 4D.

## Use
Select a spline object, run the script! (In C4D R23 you can run scripts from the 'Extensions' > 'User Scripts' menu)

The script will create nulls to control each anchor point in your spline.
